OVER
BLACK
Sounds
of
the
inner
spaces
rushing
forward.
Then
a
splinter
of
blue
light
in
the
center
of
the
picture.
It
breaks
wide,
showing
the
top
and
bottom
a
silhouetted
curtain
of
razor
sharp
teeth
suggesting
that
we
are
inside
of
a
tremendous
gullet,
looking
out
at
the
on
rushing
under
sea
world
at
night.
HEAR
a
symphony
of
underwater
sounds:
landslide,
metabolic
sounds,
the
rare
and
secret
noises
that
certain
under
sea
species
share
with
each
other.
Also,
the
hint
of
familiar
music,
twisted
and
distorted
by
the
depths.
CUT
TO:
EXT.
BEACH
NIGHT
SHARK'S
POINT
OF
VIEW
RISING
OUT
OF
THE
WATER,
LOOKING
AT
It
is
a
pleasant,
moonlit,
windless
night
in
mid-
June.
We
see
a
long
straight
stretch
of
white
beach.
Behind
the
low
dunes
are
the
dark
shapes
of
large
expensive
houses.
Hear
a
number
of
voices
singing.
It
sounds
like
an
eastern
university's
almamater,
no
longer
distorted.
EXT.
BEACH
NIGHT
ANOTHER
ANGLE
Around
a
blazing
bonfire,
a
group
of
young
men
and
women,
beer
cans
in
evidence,
as
well
as
the
bota
Spanish
leather
wine-
bag
much
in
favor
by
beach
and
ski-
bum
types.
The
group
is
swapping
sentimental
almamaters,
weepily
singing
eastern
Ivy
League
anthems-
Dartmouth,
Cornell,
Harvard,
Penn,
etc.
Two
young
people
break
away
from
the
others.
They
are
Tom
Cassidy
and
Chrissie.
Behind
them,
there
is
considerable
necking
activity;
Tom
and
Chrissie
are
more
serious.
TOM
Makes
a
clumsy
attempt
at
snaring
Chrissie,
cups
her
from
behind.
She
squirms
playfully
out
of
his
grasp.
We
discover
he's
not
especially
sober.
TOM
Hey!
Hey
hey!
I'm
with
you,
right?

They
laugh
together,
and
exchange
a
short,
fierce
kiss.
QUINT
Cast
off
the
bow
line!
Now
your
stern!
Its
diesels
chugging,
the
Orca
pulls
away
from
the
pier.
Ellen
has
already
resolutely
turned
her
back
on
it,
and
is
walking
off
the
dock
back
onto
dry
land.
ABOARD
THE
ORCA
Quint
has
set
a
course
out
towards
the
open
sea.
He
lashes
the
wheel,
and
jumps
down
to
address
Hooper
and
Brody,
who
are
standing
together
in
the
stern.
QUINT
(to
Brody)
Front-Bow,
Back-Stern,
Port,
Starboard.
Aloft,
Below.
It's
not
a
staircase,
it's
a
ladder,
it's
not
a
rope,
it's
a
line,
and
if
you
don't
get
it
right...
(indicates
porthole)
I'll
throw
your
ass
through
that
little
round
window.
He
laughs
at
his
joke.
This
is
probably
something
he
tells
all
his
charters.
QUINT
Now
hear
this.
You're
aboard
the
fishing
vessel
'Orca,'
and
I'm
her
Captain,
Master,
Mate,
and
Owner.
You'll
jump
when
I
holler.
We're
doin'
a
job
here,
and
Christ,
I
ain't
got
time
to
watch
you
birds
get
hooks
in
your
ass
and
fall
overboard.
Ship
with
me,
and
you'll
do
all
right.
Cross
me,
and
I'll
slap
you
upside
your
heads.
Now
--
if
you
boys
are
ready
--
let's
go
fishin'.
He
starts
moving
gear
around,
preparing
chum
barrels,
setting
hooks,
Hooper
gives
him
a
hand,
Brody
stays
out
of
the
way.
DISSOLVE

THE
OCEAN

NOON
It
is
quiet
as
the
Orca
drifts
along
in
the
current,
a
wide
chum
slick
spreading
behind
it.
A
couple
of
flag
buoys
spread
along
our
perspective
show
us
the
miles
the
boat
has
gone.
Quint
spots
something
in
the
water
--
a
small
blue
shark
attracted
by
the
chum.
He
rigs
a
small
pole
with
a
piece
of
bait,
and
throws
it
over
the
side.
QUINT
Here's
something
for
you...
The
shark
takes
the
bait,
Quint
brutally
and
efficiently
sets
the
hook,
and
reels
the
shark
alongside.
He
hauls
it
part
way
out
of
the
water,
and
sticks
it
with
a
gaff.
Hooper
and
Brody
watch.

Tailrope
dropping
on

Gaffed
and
bleeding,
the
shark
is
immobilized
by
Quint's
practiced
hands.
He
takes
one
of
his
big
knives
and
poses
for
a
moment
beside
the
struggling
fish.
QUINT
These
greedy
sons-a-bitches
will
eat
their
own
guts.
He
slices
into
the
shark's
underbelly.
We
hear
the
sound
of
entrails
plopping
into
the
water.
Brody
is
almost
retching,
and
Hooper
is
just
displeased.

in
a

frenzy,
jaws
snapping,

a
sudden
display
of
the
fury
and
blind
predatory
drive
of
the
fearsome
species.
HOOPER
What's
that
supposed
to
prove?
QUINT
Just
a
little
appetizer.
I
want
our
porker
to
know
we're

I
want
to

AS
WE
DISSOLVE
TO:
EXT.
THE
OCEAN
-
AFTERNOON
The
Orca
is
drifting
in
neutral.
The
ocean
is
like
gelatin,
the
sun
sucking
heat
waves
from
its
surface.
Brody
at
the
stern,
handkerchief
on
his
head
to
protect
from
further
sunburn,
has
been
handed
the
slimiest
job
on
a
shark
hunt:
the
ladling
out
of
chum.
There
are
several
empty
chum
barrels.
A
flag
buoy
bobs
in
the
wake
of
the
boat,
another
waits
to
be
tossed
over
the
side.
Brody
is
reeling
with
nausea.
He
opens
his
overnight
kit
and
takes
out
a
handkerchief
and
some
Old
Spice
after-shave.
He
pours
the
after-shave
into
the
cloth,
presses
it
to
his
nose.
Hooper
is
also
in
the
stern.
QUINT
Keep
that
chum
line
going
--
we've
got
five
good
miles.
Don't
break
it.
BRODY
Who's
driving
the
boat?
QUINT
Nobody.
We're
drifting
with
the
current.
HOOPER
(using
the
fish
finder)
Nothing.
Nothing,
nothing,
nothing.
QUINT
(to
Hooper)
Hell,
in
the
old
days
we
went
out
with
good
charts,
good
sounding
lead,
and
a
damn
good
compass.
Nowadays,
these
kids
are
afraid
to
go
out
without
depth
finders,
radar,
radio,
electric
toothbrush,
every
stupid
thing...
Quint
opens
a
can
of
beer
and
drains
it
in
one
long
pull,
crushing
the
empty
and
throwing
it
over
the
side.
Hooper
drains
his
coffee
from
a
styrofoam
cup,
and
cracks
it
in
his
hand
with
a
silly
"plup."
He
stows
the
pieces
in
an
empty
chum
barrel.
QUINT
(to
Brody)
Get
a
fresh
barrel.
Brody
goes
to
unlash
a
fresh
barrel,
but
can't
figure
out
the
knots.
He
finally
tugs
on
a
piece
of
rope,
and
it
all
comes
loose...
barrel,
shark
cage,
and,
most
important,
Hooper's
tanks,
clattering
and
rolling

HOOPER

Boom!

QUINT

Real

it

mean
a
thing
to
Mr.
Whitey,
of
course...
he
didn't
go

He
was

what
he
does
best.
Eat.
He's
a
swimming
appetite.
'Course
he
might
eat
this
stuff,
but
then
I've

him

boat.
Hooper
on
the
flying
bridge.
Quint
in
the
stern,
Brody
hanging
over
the
rail,
puking.
Quint
takes
a
wide
red
strip
of
whale
meat
and
a
gnarled
squid
from
the
garbage
pail,
and
searches
for
a
No.
2
hook
rig.
He
holds
up
a
strip
of
whale.
HOOPER
(eyeing
bait)
That's
pilot
whale,
isn't
it?
QUINT
It
ain't
a
Big
Mac.
(to
Brody)
The
expert
don't
approve.
What
do
you
thing?
You're
closer
to
the
situation.
(laughs)
Brody
shades
his
eyes
from
the
white
sun
as
Quint
baits
up.
BRODY
(croaky)
Why
are
we
way
out
here,
when
the
shark's
back
there?
QUINT
(snapping
bait
to
his
leader)
...'cause
this
is
where
he
lives.
You
gotta
think
like
they
do.
HOOPER
(to
himself)
Easy
for
you
--
they
got
a
brain
the
size
of
a
radish.
Quint
sits
in
the
fighting
chair.
He
casts
off,
murmuring
as
the
line
feeds
out.
QUINT
(to
Brody)
Now
if
he
weren't
around,
we'd
of
hooked
something
else
by
now,
wouldn't
we?
But
he
scared
'em
all
away.
Big
lonesome
son
of
a
bitch...
DISSOLVE
TO:
LATER
Quint
at
ease
in
his
chair,
Brody
near
him,
practicing
tying
knots.
The
line
starts
to
move,
a
few
feet
at
a
time;
both
men
watch.
Then
the
line
whizzes
off
the
reel.
Brody
jumps
up.
Hooper
springs
to
the
deck.
Quint
puts
his
hand
on
the
drag
and
addresses
the
situation
softly.
QUINT
--
he'll
gulp
it
down
now...
(making
gulping
noises)
Hooooooo!
Quint
tightens
drag
and
strikes.
The
line
goes
whizzing
out.
Brody
runs
to
Quint's
side.
Hooper
springs
up
to
the
flying
bridge.
BRODY
You
got
it?
QUINT
(turning
with
the
pull)
Get
behind
me,
dummy!
(shouts
to
Hooper)
Reverse
her
and
turn
--
he's
taking
too
much
line!
(to
Brody)
Wet
my
reel,
quick!
Brody
goes
to
get
water,
the
boat
surges,
he
staggers.
Brody
pours
water
on
the
screaming
reel,
nearly
unspooled
now.
Hooper
is
turning
the
boat
around
and
the
line
changes
direction.
QUINT
(straining,
muscles
popping)
Starboard,
for
Chris'sake
--
Hooper
steers
it
sharply.
QUINT
(to
Hooper)
Hey,
you!
Farmer!
Half-speed
there...
HOOPER
(almost
to
himself)
Aye,
Aye
SIR.
Stand
by
to
repel
boarders.
Poop
the
mainsail.
Argh,
Jim
Boy.
Again
the
line
changes
direction,
down
this
time.
QUINT
(to
Hooper)
Neutral!
(to
himself)
Where
the
hell
is
he
going?
Quint
reeling
in
like
mad.
QUINT
Oh,
this
ain't
foolin'
me
--
(rod
arcs
down
with
a
surge)
Sure
--
try
it!
He
ad
libs
brief
instructions
to
Brody
as
the
line
rushes
out
and
there
is
less
tension.
Quint
is
horsing
up
and
down,
reeling
in.
QUINT
Makin'
believe
it's
easy
now.
The
line
is
almost
vertical,
and
Quint
shows
a
hint
of
bafflement.
He
reels
in
suspiciously.
QUINT
Gettin'
ready
to
run
again
--
no?
No?
(suspicious)
What's
he
playin'
here?
(reels
in
furiously,
to
Brody)
Put
the
gloves
on!
(to
fish)
Let's
see
who's
gonna
tease
who
now!
HOOPER
Let
it
go,
don't
waste
your
time.
QUINT
(to
Hooper)
Down
here,
Hooper!
Hooper
is
rushing
down.
HOOPER
I
don't
know
what
it
is,
but
it's
not
a
shark.
QUINT
(bathed
in
sweat;
hauling,
reeling)
Look
--
you
may
be
a
big
Yahoo
in
the
lab,
but
out
here
you're
just
supercargo,
and
you'll
do
as
I
say,
or
you
can
take
your
gear
and
backstroke
home.
Now
get
down
here!
The
leaders
show
above
the
water
line.
Brody
is
wide-eyed,
waiting
for
that
first
look.
BRODY
The
wire's
showing!
QUINT
(to
Brody)
Unbuckle
me
--
fast!
(to
Hooper)
Grab
the
leader.
He
ain't
normal,
this
one...
they
never
--
HOOPER
It's
too
wild,
too
erratic.
It's
a
marlin
or
a
stingray.
It's
a
gamefish.
Hooper
snaps
the
rope
onto
the
leader
and
holds
on.
QUINT
Watch
your
hands
--
(suddenly
to
Brody)
Grab
onto
this!
Before
he
realizes
what's
happening,
Brody
is
clumsily
clutching
at
the
big
rod,
appalled.
Quint
skips
away
for
a
flying
gaff.
He
picks
one,
turns...
That's
when
the
leader
lashes
free,
sending
Hooper
crashing
backward
in
a
serious
fall,
and
the
rod
whips
at
Brody's
forehead,
drawing
blood.
Quint
snatches
up
the
rod
and
reels
in.
The
wires
have
been
bitten
through.
QUINT
(to
Hooper)
A
marlin,
or
a
stingray.
Huh.
Don't
ever
tell
me
my
business
again.
Get
back
up
on
the
bridge.
HOOPER
(stunned)
I'm
okay...
QUINT
(to
Brody)
Fasten
the
pole.
BRODY
What's
the
point
with
hooks
and
Lines?
--
QUINT
Don't
tell
me
my
business!
(to
Hooper,
points)
Quarter-mile,
that
way.
Full
throttle.
Hooper
shakes
off
his
dizziness
and
obeys.
Brody
watches
Quint
rig
up
a
new
leader,
hook
up
the
same
bait.
BRODY
(nursing
forehead,
gesturing
at
rod
and
reel)
How
--
if
they're
gonna
keep
on
breaking?
QUINT
What
I
do
is
trick
him
to
the
surface,
got
that?
Then
I
can
jab
him,
understand?
(goes
to
flybridge,
muttering)
Think
I'm
gonna
haul
it
in
as
if
he's
a
catfish,
like
everyone
else
does?
Brody
goes
inside
to
inspect
his
forehead.
ON
BRIDGE
-
HOOPER
AND
QUINT
QUINT
(suddenly,
pointing)
Over
there!
HOOPER
What
do
you
see?
QUINT
(still
looking)
At
least
you
handle
the
boat
all
right.
Stop.
Here...
Cut
the
engine.
Hooper
cuts
the
engines
as
Quint
swings
nimbly
down.
He
stands
stock
still
on
the
main
deck,
motioning
Brody
to
be
silent.
Then
picking
up
the
newly
rigged
rod,
Quint
softshoes
it
over
to
the
chair.
About
to
sit
down,
he
freezes.
CLOSE
-
QUINT
looking
hard
at
something.
CLOSE
-
BRODY
staring,
eyes
widening.
CLOSE
-
HOOPER
moving
in,
surprised,
interested,
fascinated.
THEIR
COMBINED
POINT
OF
VIEW
We
see
the
shark.
First
the
fin...
then
the
head
and
upper
jaws,
ten
or
twenty
yards
off
the
side
of
the
boat.
It
finally
submerges,
its
tail
giving
a
final
slap.
ANGLE
ON
QUINT
He
puts
his
rod
away
and
stares
at
it.
And
stares.
And
stares.
Hooper
is
the
first
to
break
the
silence.
HOOPER
20
feet,
if
it's
an
inch...
QUINT
25
feet.
And
three
tons
of
him
there.
Hooper
is
nearly
beside
himself
with
a
strange
ecstasy.
He
leaps
toward
his
gear.
QUINT
(quietly,
to
Brody)
I
never
saw
one
that
big.
BRODY
What
do
we
do?
Get
some
help?
Radio
in?
Quint
ignores
him
and
moves
off
into
the
pilot
house,
where
he
swiftly
takes
out
his
green
case,
and
opens
it
to
begin
to
assemble
something
inside
it.
Brody
is
alone
on
the
deck
with
Hooper.
BRODY
How're
we
gonna
handle
this?
Hooper
is
contained
in
his
own
excitement.
He
has
finally
come
up
with
what
he
was
looking
for
--
an
expensive
Nikon
through
which
he
peers
intently
at
the
shark
alongside.
He
is
talking
half
to
himself
as
he
fine-tunes
the
range
finder
and
focus.
He
is
squeaking
and
bubbling
in
an
unsuppressed
emotional
boil.
HOOPER
(very,
very
high)
There's
a
formula!
Girth,
about
150
inches,
squared,
divide
by
800
--
son
of
a
bitch,
they
are
not
going
to
believe
this!
--
divide
by
2000...
three
tons!
(after
Quint)
You're
right,
you
old
fart!
Three
tons!
(ad
libs
ecstasy)
CLOSE
ON
QUINT
IN
THE
PILOT
HOUSE
He
is
assembling
the
Greener
harpoon
gun,
deftly
screwing
on
the
long
wooden
stock,
the
heavy
steel
barrel,
and
big
shaft
with
the
wicked
barbs,
the
frame
all
rigged
with
line.
Past
him,
on
the
deck,
we
can
still
see
Hooper.
As
Quint
is
working
with
the
gun,
the
radio
suddenly
squawks
into
life.

This

Quint
snaps
the
mouthpiece
to
his
lips.
QUINT
Orca
here.
RADIO
VOICE
(V.O.)
I
have
Mrs.
Martin
Brody
here...
QUINT
Put
her

ELLEN'S

...push
this?
Oh.
It's
working.
Hello,
Martin?
QUINT
This
is
Quint,
Missus.
ELLEN'S
VOICE
I
just
wanted
to
know
if
you
were
all
right...
the
Coast
Guard
let
me
use
their
radio.
Is
Chief
Brody
there?
QUINT
He's
busy.
ELLEN'S
VOICE
Well...
is
everything
all
right?
QUINT
Just
fine,
Missus.
We'll
be
back
soon.
Everything's
fine.
We
haven't
seen
anything
yet.
Orca
out.
He
snaps
off
the
radio,
and,
for
good
measure,
pulls
the
plug
from
the
power
source.
ANGLE
FROM
DECK
The
big
shark
is
slicing
through
the
water
just
below
the
surface,
its
fin
high,
the
big
gray
back
glistening,
the
teeth
gleaming.
ANGLE
-
INCLUDING
FOREDECK
HOOPER
(on
deck)
Damn
it!
I
need
something
in
the
foreground
to
give
it
some
scale.
Martin!
Stand
here!
No,
to
your
left!
He
is
positioning
Martin
frantically,
trying
to
include
Brody,
the
shark,
and
the
Orca
in
the
same
frame.
Quint
finishes
with
the
gun,
and
as
a
final
gesture,
snaps
an
explosive
cartridge
into
the
breech.
He
empties
the
box
of
cartridges
onto
the
table,
snatches
up
a
big
handful,
and
drops
them
into
a
pocket,
and
heads
out
on
deck,
bound
for
the
bow
pulpit.
ON
DECK
Quint
appears
with
the
harpoon
gun.
He
throws
one
end
of
the
line
to
Hooper.
QUINT
Here.
Rig
this
to
the
forward
keg
up
there.
He
indicates
the
barrels
on
the
foredeck.
QUINT
(to
Brody)
Get
up
there
and
steer
her.
Follow
my
hand,
and
hold
'er
steady.
I've
got
to
get
a
clean
shot
at
that
porker's
head.
Quint
moves
up
toward
the
bow,
Brody
goes
up
to
the
flying
bridge
to
take
the
wheel,
Hooper
starts
for
the
foredeck,
but
stops
to
rummage
in
his
kit,
throwing
gear
around
as
he
desperately
hunts
for
something.
QUINT
Hurry
up,
rig
the
line!
ANGLE
ON
HOOPER
He
finds
what
he's
looking
for.
A
small,
powerful
strobe
unit,
waterproofed,
a
miniature
signal
beacon.
He
triggers
it,
and
it
begins
to
pulse
with
a
light
we
can
see
even
in
the
sun.
Hooper
scampers
to
the
foredeck
and
begins
to
rig
the
light
to
the
first
barrel,
as
the
shark
begins
to
surface
near
the
bow.
QUINT
(to
Brody)
Come
to
port.
Watch
my
hand.
Steady
now...
He
guides
Brody
with
hand
signals.
Brody
tries
urgently
to
get
it
right,
not
to
oversteer,
to
try
to
hold
the
big
boat
with
its
throbbing
diesels
on
the
course
that
Quint
is
indicating.
QUINT
The
line,
man,
the
line!
Hooper
is
rigging
like
crazy.
FROM
THE
FLYING
BRIDGE
Brody
steering
f.g.,
Hooper
on
the
foredeck
with
the
barrels,
Quint
leaning
out
over
the
pulpit,
the
gun
at
the
ready,
the
shark
crossing
inexorably
in
front
of
them.
CLOSE
ON
QUINT
Agonizing
over
his
shot
as
the
shark
approaches,
glancing
back
to
see
if
the
line
is
properly
rigged
and
Hooper
is
clear
of
it.
QUINT
Get
clear,
damn
you!
The
shark
is
in
position,
Hooper
shouts,
a
moment
too
late.
HOOPER
Clear!
Quint
fires.
The
harpoon
slams
into
the
shark
behind
his
head,
half-way
along
the
back
in
front
of
the
big
dorsal
fin.

COILED

AND
BARREL
The
rope
snaps
out
in
a
blur
of
violent
motion,
Hooper
jumps
back,
and
the
barrel
leaps
out
of
its
rack,
pulled
by
the
line
rigged
to
the
harpoon.
It
bounds
forward
and
into
the
sea,
past
Quint,
who
is
already
reloading,
mounting
another
steel
shaft.
In
the
distance,
the
barrel
bobs
and
skips
violently
in
the
water,
dragged
by
the
shark
in
his
merciless
moves.
THE

QUINT
Now
you've

Let
the

for
a

He
can't
stay
down
with
that
on.
Hooper,
furious
with
himself,
runs
for
the
flying
bridge
to
take
the
helm
from
Brody.
THE

Hooper
has

forward
as
he
spins
the
wheel
in
a
frantic
180
degree
turn.
HOOPER
(to
Quint)
Rig
another
keg!
I'm
bringing
her
around!
His
eyes
dart
about
the
ocean,
looking
for
the
barrel,
as
he
hot-dogs
the
ship
around
in
a
violent
expression
of
his
own
disgust
with
himself.
HOOPER
(to
himself)
God
damn
it!
We
had
him!
(to
Quint)
I'm
coming
about!
He
spins
the
wheel
again,
trying
to
make
the
big
boat
handle
like
a
formula
speedster.
The
decks
tip
and
the
rigging
sways
under
the
sudden
strain.
Brody
is
caught
unaware,
and
tumbles
off
his
feet,
sliding
across
the
deck
to
fetch
up
against
a
wall.
the
M1
Rifle
is
close
to
his
hand.
He
stares
at
it.
FROM
THE
FLYING
BRIDGE
Hooper
is
anguished,
intense,
trying
to
find
the
shark,
spinning
the
wheel,
compounding
his
error,
tipping
the
boat
in
rolling
turns
as
he
crosses
his
own
wake.
Quint
has
turned
his
back
to
the
sea,
and
is
in
the
pulpit
looking
up
at
Hooper,
staring
at
him,
excluding
everything
else.
As
Quint
folds
his
arms
and
stares
at
Hooper,
we
realize
the
sun
is
going
down,
and
it's
getting
dark.
BRODY
Why
don't
we
go
in?
Get
another
crack
at
him
tomorrow.
QUINT
We
got
a
barrel
on
him.
We
can't
lose
him.
We
stay
out
here
until
we
find
him.
Hooper
throttles
back,
and
the
roar
of
the
diesels
subsides
and
the
boat
resumes
an
even
keel,
slowly
circling
the
ocean.
BRODY
Let's
call
in
--
we
can
radio
and
have
a
big
boat
here
in
an
hour...
QUINT

You
hired
me,
remember?
It's
my
$10,000.
It's
my
shark...

Throttled
back

the

circles
the

endlessly,
staying
over
the
shark
like
an
avenging
angel.
Its
running
lights
gleam
in
the
night,
and
a
glow
lights
the
interior
of
the

A
bright

NIGHT
Brody
and
Hooper
at
the
table,
Quint
at
the
wheel,
keeping
his
eye
on
the
light.
QUINT
He's
up
again.
He
corrects
course
slightly
to
keep
the
barrel
buoy
in
sight.
Hooper
is
sitting
at
the
table,
morose.
Brody
is
staring
at
a
couple
of
open
cans
of
beans
or
beef
stew,
or
some
other
crappy
rations
Quint
has
on
board.
Dirty
spoons
stuck
in
the
open
cans
show
us
this
has
not
been
a
formal
dinner.
Quint
fumbles
on
the
chart
shelf
and
produces
some
of
his
home
brew.
He
takes
a
pull,
and
hands
it
to
Hooper,
who
takes
a
double.
Brody
touches
the
fresh
abrasion
on
his
forehead,
where
the
fishing
rod
caught
him.
Quint
bends
forward
and
pulls
his
hair
aside
to
show
something
near
the
crown.
QUINT
That's
not
so
bad.
Look
at
this:
...St.
Paddy's
Day
in
Knocko
Nolans,
in
Boston,
where
some
sunovabitch
winged
me
upside
the
head
with
a
spittoon.
Brody
looks
politely.
Hooper
stirs
himself.
HOOPER
Look
here.
(extends
a
forearm)
Steve
Kaplan
bit
me
during
recess.
Quint
is
amused.
He
presents
his
own
formidable
forearm.
QUINT
Wire
burn.
Trying
to
stop
a
backstay
from
taking
my
head
off.
HOOPER
(rolling
up
a
sleeve)
Moray
Eel.
Bit
right
through
a
wet
suit.
Brody
is
fascinated.
Quint
and
Hooper
take
a
long
pull
from
the
bottle.
QUINT
Face
and
head
scars
come
from
amateur

This

here...
(he
bends
an
ear
forward)
...that's
from
some
crazy
Frenchie
come
after
me
with
a
knife.
I
caught
him
with
a
good
right
hand
right
in
the
snot
locker
and
laid
him
amongst
the
sweetpeas.
HOOPER
Ever
see
one
like
this?
He
hauls
up
his
pants
leg,
revealing
a
wicked
white
scar.
HOOPER
Bull
shark
scraped
me
while
I
was
taking
samples...
QUINT
Nothing!
A
pleasure
scar.
Look
here
--
He
starts
rolling
up
his
own
dirty
pants
leg.
QUINT
Slammed
with
a
thresher's
tail.
Look
just
like
somebody
caressed
me
with
a
nutmeg
grater...
Brody
is
drawn
into
their
boasting
comparisons.
He
secretly
checks
his
own
appendix
scar,
decides
not
to
enter
the
contest.
HOOPER
I'll
drink
to
your
leg.
QUINT
And
I'll
drink
to
yours.
They
toast
each
other.
Brody
looks
around,
sees
the
strobe
blink
once
through
the
darkened
window.
QUINT
Wait
a
minute,
young
fella.
Look.
Just
look.
Don't
touch...
He
starts
lowering
his
pants
to
reveal
a
place
on
one
hip
where
the
tissue
is
scarred
and
irregular.
QUINT
...Mako.
Fell
out

the

and
onto
the
deck.
You
don't
get
bitten
by
one
of
those
bastards
but
twice
--
your
first
and
your
last.
HOOPER
(considerably
drunker)
I
think
I
can
top
that,
Mister...
Hooper
is
pulling
at
his
shirt,
trying
to
get
it
off,
but
it's
tangling
its
sleeves,
and
won't
come
undone.
HOOPER
Gimme
a
hand,
here.
I
got
something
to
show
you
--
Brody
lends
a
hand.
The
shirt
slips
part
way
off.
HOOPER
(indicating
his
chest)
There.
Right
there.
Mary
Ellen
Moffit
broke
my
heart.
Let's
drink
to
Mary
Ellen.
The
two

raise
their

QUINT
And
here's

And
here's
to
their

I'd
rather
one
Miss

drinks,

Brody
is
looking

a
small
white
patch
on
Quint's
other
forearm.
BRODY
(pointing)
What's
that
one,
there?
QUINT
(changing)
Tattoo.
Had
it
taken
off.
HOOPER
Don't

'Death

Dishonor.'
'Mother.'
'Semper

Uhhh...
'Don't

BRODY
What's
that,

HOOPER
(incredulous)
You
were
on
the
Indianapolis?
In
'45?
Jesus...
Quint
remembering.
CLOSE
ON
QUINT
QUINT
Yeah.
The
U.S.S.
Indianapolis.
June
29th,
1945,
three
and
a
half
minutes
past
midnight,
two
torpedoes
from
a
Japanese
submarine
slammed
into
our
side.
Two
or
three.
We
was
still
under
sealed
orders
after
deliverin'
the
bomb...the
Hiroshima
bomb...we
was
goin'
back
across
the
Pacific
from
Tinian
to
Leyte.
Damn
near
eleven
hundred
men
went
over
the
side.
The
life
boats
was
lashed
down
so
tight
to
make
the
bomb
run
we
couldn't
cut
a
single
one
adrift.
Not
one.
And
there
was
no
rafts.
None.
That
vessel
sank
in
twelve
minutes.
Yes,
that's
all
she
took.
We
didn't
see
the
first
shark
till
we'd
been
in
the
water
about
an
hour.
A
thirteen-footer
near
enough.
A
blue.
You
measure
that
by
judgin'
the
dorsal
to
the
tail.
What
we
didn't
know...
of
course
the
Captain
knew...I
guess
some
officers
knew...
was
the
bomb
mission
had
been
so
secret,
no
distress
signals
was
sent.
What
the
men
didn't
know
was
that
they
wouldn't
even
list
us
as
overdue
for
a
week.
Well,
I
didn't
know
that
--
I
wasn't
an
officer
--
just
as
well
perhaps.
So
some
of
us
were
dead
already
--
in
the
water
--
just
hangin'
limp
in
our
lifejackets.
And
several
already
bleedin'.
And
the
three
hundred
or
so
laying
on
the
bottom
of
the
ocean.
As
the
light
went,
the
sharks
came
crusin'.
We
formed
tight
groups
--
somewhat
like
squares
in
an
old
battle
--
You
know
what
I
mean
--
so
that
when
one
come
close,
the
man
nearest
would
yell
and
shout
and
pound
the
water
and
sometimes
it
worked
and
the
fish
turned
away,
but
other
times
that
shark
would
seem
to
look
right
at
a
man
--
right
into
his
eyes
--
and
in
spite
of
all
shoutin'
and
poundin'
you'd
hear
that
terrible
high
screamin'
and
the
ocean
would
go
red,
then
churn
up
as
they
ripped
him.
Then
we'd
reform
our
little
squares.
By
the
first
dawn
the
sharks
had
taken
more
than
a
hundred.
Hard
for
me
to
count
but
more
than
a
hundred.
I
don't
know
how
many
sharks.
Maybe
a
thousand.
I
do
know
they
averaged
six
men
an
hour.
All
kinds
--
blues,
makos,
tigers.
All
kinds.
(Pause)
In
the
middle
of
the
second
day,
some
of
us
started
to
go
crazy
from
the
thirst.
One
fella
cried
out
he
saw
a
river,
another
claimed
he
saw
a
waterfall,
some
started
to
drink
the
ocean
and
choked
on
it,
and
some
left
our
little
groups
--
our
little
squares
--
and
swam
off
alone
lookin'
for
islands
and
the
sharks
always
took
them
right
away.
It
was
mainly
the
young
fellas
that
did
that
--
the
older
ones
stayed
where
they
was.
That
second
day
--
my
life
jacket
rubbed
me
raw
and
that
was
more
blood
in
the
water.
Oh
my.
On
Thursday
morning
I
bumped
up
against
a
friend
of
mine
--
Herbie
Robinson
from
Cleveland
--
a
bosun's
mate
--
it
seemed
he
was
asleep
but
when
I
reached
over
to
waken
him,
he
bobbed
in
the
water
and
I
saw
his
body
upend
because
he'd
been
bitten
in
half
beneath
the
waist.
Well
Chief,
so
it
went
on
--
bombers
high
overhead
but
nobody
noticin'
us.
Yes
--
suicides,
sharks,
and
all
this
goin'
crazy
and
dyin'
of
thirst.
Noon
the
fifth
day,
Mr.
Hooper,
a
Lockheed
Ventura
swung
around
and
came
in
low.
Yes.
He
did
that.
Yes,
that
pilot
saw
us.
And
early
evenin',
a
big
fat
PBY
come
down
out
of
the
sky
and
began
the
pickup.
That
was
when
I
was
most
frightened
of
all
--
while
I
was
waitin'
for
my
turn.
Just
two
and
a
half
hours
short
of
five
days
and
five
nights
when
they
got
to
me
and
took
me
up.
Eleven
hundred
of
us
went
into
that
ocean
--
three
hundred
and
sixteen
got
out.
Yeah.
Nineteen
hundred
and
forty
five.
June
the
29th.
(pause)
Anyway,
we
delivered
the
bomb.

the

slowly
circling
in

the
warm

in

barely
revealing
the

the
three
men
inside,
the
red
and
green
running
lights
winking
along
the

drawn-out
hoot
of
a

What

HOOPER
It's

out
there.
There's
a
brief,
eerie
pause.
Quint
breaks
the
silence
by
muttering
into
song,
which
he
slowly
swells.
QUINT
(singing)
Show
me
the
way
to
go
home...
I'm
tired
and
I
want
to
go

I
had
a
little
drink
about
an
hour
ago,
and
it
went
right
to
my
head.
(etc.)
Gradually,
Hooper
and
Brody
join
in,
and
the
pilothouse
becomes
a
warm
cozy
place.

In

the

light
flash
up
into

and
behind
them,
the

surfaces,

glides
ominously
towards

The
song
is
continuing,
and
we
hear
the
barest
hint
of
a
scraping
sound
from
the
hull
deep
beneath
the
men.
Quint's
eyes
abruptly
narrow
as
his
sensitive
ears
are
the
first
to
hear
the
abrasion
of
his
ship.
Things
vibrate
on
the
shelves.
Quint
stops
singing,
Hooper
and
Brody
continue
a
duet.
The
scraping
repeats,
and
Hooper
now
senses
it.
He
drops
out
of
the
song,
leaving
Brody
singing
solo.
QUINT
(quietly,
to
Hooper)
Start
the
engines.
As
Brody
hears
this
and
is
about
to
stop
singing,
the
boat
is
suddenly
bumped
from
below,
and
the
gentle
scraping
turns
to
a
violent
assault
somewhere
on
the
understructure
of
the
vessel.
Water
bubbles
up
into
the
hold.
Brody
starts,
and
looks
at
the
radio.
He
is
about
to
move
towards
it
when
Quint's
urgent
instructions
stop
him.
QUINT

Get

Brody

Keep

Hooper
stands
ready
on

Quint
pacing

QUINT
Nobody

Nobody.
He
jams
a
fresh

The

Quint

Hooper

Quint
have
a

and
are
working
together
to
repair
the

torn
loose

Hooper

is
hammering
away

trying
to

Bits

clutter
the

Brody

HOOPER

Lemme

Now.
Quint
hammers
again.
QUINT
He's
bent
the

You
can
hear
it.
And
we
can.
The
Orca's
diesels
are
no
longer
smooth.
Brody
suddenly
sees
something,
and
points.
BRODY'S
POINT
OF
VIEW
-
THE
WATER
The
barrel
is
surfaced
directly
ahead
of
them,
just
off
the
port
side.
They
are
drifting
up
to
it.
BRODY
The
barrel!
The
strobe
light
winks
at
them.
Quint
holds
up
a
hand:
"Quiet!"
Everything
stops
as
they
watch
the
barrel
coming
slowly
up
on
them.
QUINT
It's
him.
He
takes
a
killing
lance
from
the
rack.
Hooper
gets
a
boathook.
QUINT
He's
under
the
keg.
Careful
--
Hooper
leans
out
gingerly,
snagging
the
barrel
with
the
hook.
It
bobs
lightly
in
the
water,
an
innocent
bystander.
Hooper
shifts
his
pole,
takes
hold
of
the
rope,
poling
it
in.
QUINT
(suspicious)
Easy
--
just
want
to
goose
him
up.
The
minute
he
runs,
drop
it
or
you'll
lose
your
hands.
Hooper
gets
the
line
and
starts
hauling
it
up.
No
resistance.
It
comes
easily
over
the
transom
into
a
coil
on
the
deck.
He
and
Quint
exchange
looks.
QUINT
Here

I
don't
see

side.
From
the
opposite
starboard
direction,
fully
unfastened
from
the
barrel,
comes
the
Great
White.
First
the
fin,
then
the
conical
nose
and
the
upper
border
of
wide,
grinning
teeth.
It
knifes
through
the
water
in
absolute
silence,
propelling
itself
with
tremendous
speed
toward
the
unsuspecting
men.

QUINT
They
turn
just

a
long
spine-stretch
saves
them
from
instant
decapitation.
The
Great
White
passes
the
transom,
the
harpoon
still
in
its
side
and
trailing
five
feet
of
chewed-
off
cable.
It
rolls
on
its
side
and
looks
at
them
as
it
passes.
Past
the
stern
the
huge
tail
lashes
out,
ripping
the
rope
out
of
Quint's
hands,
shearing
a
huge
swath
through
the
paint,
peeling
it
off
like
a
plane,
taking
one
of
the
bronze
letters
out
of
"Orca."
The
shark
begins
an
arc
to
sea,
its
fin
cutting
the
water,
and
starts
circling
the
boat.
Quint
notices
his
cut
hand,
palm
bleeding,
realizing
how
close
he
came
to
losing
it.
QUINT

Haul

Hooper
slams

kicks
the

the

action
once

QUINT
Excuse

Brody's

turns
his
fear
into
rage.
His

are
cracked

broken
by
flying
pieces

He
seizes

Brody
looks
around.
Hooper
on
the
flying
bridge
searching
in
all
directions.
Quint
is
looking
more
appalled
every
second.
QUINT
(helplessly)
He
can't
stay
down
with
three
barrels
on
him!
Where
is
he?!
BRODY
Have
you
ever
had
one
do
this?
QUINT
(and
he
means
this)
No!
Booming
thud
at
the
keel.
Brody
slides
on
the
wet
deck
and
Quint
loses
his
footing,
falling
into
Brody's
arms.
WITH
HOOPER
ON
THE
FLY
BRIDGE
It
seems
the
only
place
out
of
reach
of
the
shark.
Quint
climbs
up,
Brody
following
him,
reloading
his
pistol.
Just
then,
the
barrels
pop
up
ahead,
veer
left,
and
duck
under.
QUINT
Follow
him!
HOOPER
He's
under!
BRODY
AND
HIS
POINT
OF
VIEW
BRODY
There!
(points
wildly)
The
barrels
have
surfaced
and
we
see
the
monster
shadow
sliding
under
the
Orca,
seemingly
endless.
Violent
scraping
sounds.
BRODY
He's
trying
to
sink
us!
QUINT
(to
Hooper)
Dead
astern!
Zig-zag!
Quint
is
grimly
silent.
Brody
senses
that
Quint
is
in
the
fight
of
(and
for)
his
life.
The
Orca
taking
evasive
action.
But
the
three
barrels
are
closing
the
gap,
the
engines
coughing
and
missing,
destroying
themselves
with
every
rotation
of
the
damaged
shaft.
BRODY
He's
chasing
us!
I
don't
believe
it.
QUINT
Full
throttle!
To
port!
ANGLE
ON
THE
BRIDGE
Hooper
is
jamming
the
throttle
forward,
but
the
engine
is
pounding
and
knocking
wildly.
The
barrels
circle
and
move
in.
Quint
has
his
rifle
ready.
HOOPER
(suddenly
giving
Quint
the
wheel)
Hold
her.
He
leaps
to
his
gear,
trying
desperately
to
get
his
dart
gun.
Just
then,
the
shark
attacks,
breaking
water
and
rising
over
the
boat
like
a
rocket;
snout,
jaws,
pectoral
fins,
belly,
falling
sideways.
A
vast
spray
drenches
the
men.
Quint
fires
into
the
belly,
the
bullets
pocking
the
smooth
whiteness.
HOOPER
(loading)
Keep
him
there!
Keep
him!
The
Orca
shudders
from
side
to
side.
From
Hooper's
point
of
view
we
can
the
shark
gripping
the
transom
in
his
jaws,
shaking
the
boat
as
he
saws
his
massive
head
from
side
to
side,
trying
to
tear
a
chunk
out
of
the
very
hull.
Quint
has
reloaded
and
is
firing
into
the
fish.
Brody
has
a
wicked
pointed
gaff,
and
is
swinging
wildly
at
the
snout,
gashing
and
gouging
it,
trying
for
the
eyes.
The
killing
lust
is
on
all
three
men.
QUINT
Throttling
back!
The
boat
surges,
the
shark
gives
a
final
unbalances
wrench,
and
disengages.
The
dorsal
fin
circles
off,
beginning
a
wide
loop
around
the
boat.
The
engine
quivers
and
dies,
the
boat
without
power,
rolling
half
awash,
a
wounded
victim.
The
fin
dips,
the
barrels
follow,
the
shark
disappears
beneath
the
waves.
There
is
complete
silence.
THE
THREE
MEN
ON
DECK
In
the
dead
quiet,
we
can
hear
the
lap
of
waves
against
the
hull,
the
hoarse
panting
breathing
of
the
men,
the
pings
and
pops
of
the
cooling,
dying
engines.
QUINT
AND
THE
TRANSOM
He
eyes
the
stern.
Huge
cracks
and
broken
timber
testify
to
the
fury
of
the
attack.
QUINT
(very
quietly,
to
Hooper)
What
can
that
gun
of
yours
do?
HOOPER
Power
head
with
20
ccs
of
strychnine
nitrate.
If
I
can
hit
him.
I
can
kill
him.
But
I
gotta
be
close.
Very
close.
BRODY
(the
awful
realization)
You
gotta
go
in
the
water...
CUT
TO:
ON
DECK,
LATER
Quint
and
Hooper
are
assembling
the
shark
cage,
its
shiny
bars
the
only
undamaged
things
on
deck.
Brody
is
working
too,
bolting
the
sections
together.
HOOPER
(in
command
now)
Rig
the
cable
to
the
roof
eyebolts.
The
men
are
speaking
in
near
whispers,
quiet
in
the
silence
that
surrounds
them.
Hooper
is
in
his
wet
suit,
adjusting
weights,
mask,
tanks,
etc.
The
cage
is
standing
in
the
stern.
Quint
runs
a
line
from
the
gin
pole
to
the
roof
section.
Hooper
climbs
in
though
the
top.
HOOPER
Take
me
up.
Brody
cranks
the
winch,
hoisting
cage
and
Hooper
into
the
air.
Quint
balances
the
gin
pole
lines,
Hooper
crouching
in
the
cage,
examining
it
for
stresses;
satisfied,
he
holds
out
his
hand.
Quint
puts
the
spear
gun
into
it.
CLOSE
ON
HOOPER
IN
THE

He
examines
his

the
power

with
the
big
wicked-looking
syringe
head
uncapped
to
reveal
its
razor

HOOPER
Lower
away,
Chief.
(then,
to
Quint)
Try
and
keep
him
off
me
till
I'm
under.
Hooper
inside,
looking
out
the
bars
of
the
cage,
gives
Brody
a
reassuring
smile,
then
pops
his
mouthpiece
between
his
teeth
and
checks
his
regulator.
Brody
steps
back,
and
with
Quint
guiding
the
cage,
begins
lowering
it
off
the
gin
pole
boom
arm
into
the
sea
alongside
the
boat.
Brody
and
Hooper
stare
at
each
another
as
their
faces
pass,
Hooper
sliding
down
into
the
cold
grey
ocean.
As
Hooper
disappears
beneath
the
surface,
Quint
and
Brody
exchange
a
long
look
between
them.

Their
turning

still
circling.
Suddenly,
both
heads
stop
turning.
THE
SEA
The
barrels
have
come
to
a
stop.
Delicately,
they
change
course
and
meander
toward
the
lowered
cage.
UNDERWATER

HOOPER
His
back
is
to
us.
He
is
just
now
completing
a
visual
sweep
and
turns,
eyes
front
into
closeup
and:
fixes
wildly
on
something
monstrous...
and
fascinating.
HOOPER'S
POINT
OF
VIEW
The
water
is
clear
and
shafts
of
sunlight
streak
downward
in
the
blue.
From
the
deep
gloom
--
diving
slowly,
smoothly
--
comes
the
shark.
It
moves
with
no
apparent
effort,
sinuous
beyond
comparison.
As
it
nears
the
cage,
it
turns,
and
its
ghastly
length
passes
right
in
front
of
him:
first
the
snout,
then
the
jaw,
slack
and
smiling,
then
the
black
eye.
Hooper
tentatively
reaches
out.
It
is
too
far
for
the
strychnine
pole.
The
vinyl
flesh
is
pocked
with
bullet
holes,
iron
scars,
gaffing
hooks
and
strange
open
wounds

HOOPER
-
CLOSE
The
shark
has
vanished
into
a
cloud
of
rising
silt.
Hooper,
expecting
the
shark
to
attack
out
of
that
same
general
direction,
braces
himself,
pole
extended
through
the
bars,
breathing
faster,
straining
his
eyes
into
the
gloom
and...
we
see
that
the
shark
attacking
from
behind
him.
The
cage
is
sent
careening.
Hooper
grabs
the
bars
for
dear
life.
The
shark
has
grabbed
the
steel
struts
in
its
brutal
jaws,
shaking
the
cage
relentlessly
from
side
to
side,
bending
the
bars
like
clothes
hangers.
Hooper
can't
turn
the
pointed
end
of
the
pole
around,
his
body
jammed
as
far
away
from
the
non-rational
attacker
as
possible.
Hooper
is
trapped.
The
shark
withdraws
to
get
some
running
room
then
charges
again.
The
bleeding
snout
thrust
deeper
into
the
yawing
bars,
the
jaws
snapping
and
twisting,
two
feet
from
Hooper's
torso,
the
tail
thrusting
it
forward.
Hooper
drops
the
strychnine
pole
between
the
bars
and
it
tumbles
slowly
toward
rapture
depth.
All
the
shark
needs
is
one
more
good
thrust
before
separating
Hooper
at
the
waistline.
Through
frantic
bubbles
Hooper
fumbles
with
the
overhead
hatch
cover,
kicking
up
and
out
of
the
cage.
The
shark
backpedals
with
its
tail,
but
the
broad
head
won't
shake
loose.
Hooper
rushes
downwards,
after
the
strychnine
pole.

The

twists
free
of

Hooper
nearly
recovers
the
pole.
Again
it
slips
from
his
frightened
grasp
and
this
time
disappears
into
a
narrow
abyss.
Hooper

NIGHTMARE
ANGLE
-
DECK
OF
THE
ORCA
The
giant
jaws
are
snapping
irresistibly
at
everything:
great
chunks
of
wood
torn
out
of
the
deck
and
superstructure.
Deck
chair,
irons,
rope,
gear,
beercans,
bottles,
Brody's
bag,
all
are
food
for
the
insatiable
maw
blindly
churning
away.
Quint
is
clinging
next
to
a
rack
of
lances:
he
is
enraged
at
this
ultimate
violation
of
his
territory.
He
snatches
up
a
lance
and
hurls
himself
at
the
shark
with
a
wordless
bellow.
The
great
head
weaves
side
to
side,
the
deck
is
at
a
treacherous
incline,
slippery
with
blood
and
seawater.
Quint's
footing
falters
and
slips,
he
stumbles
at
the
Mouth
of
Hell,
the
big
teeth
seize
him
and
snap.
Quint's
roar
of
rage
and
pain
is
choked
off
as
his
body
is
clamped
between
the
grinding,
sawing
teeth,
and
his
head
and
legs
suddenly
contort
as
the
shark's
teeth
meet
across
his
torso.
Blood
gushes
onto
the
deck.
The
remnants
of
his
body
tumble
from
the
shark's
mouth.
Brody
sees
the
horror,
hears
the
screams
--
in
his
desperation,
he
tears
loose
one
of
Hooper's
remaining
air
tanks,
and
hurls
it
at
the
monster.
It
tumbles
into
the
bloody
well,
wedging
across
the
back
of
the
mouth,
the
thick
steel
blocking
the
cruel
jaws.
The
shark's
head
shakes
even
more
violently,
trying
to
clear
the
cold
iron,
but
the
tank
is
in
to
stay.
DECK
OF
THE
ORCA,
LISTING
BADLY
To
avoid
sliding
into
the
jaws,
Brody
scrambles
on
the
titling
deck,
bracing
himself
in
the
cabin
door
to
avoid
pitching
down
into
the
bloody
mouth.
He
fights
his
way
into
the
cabin,
already
a
shambles.
Below
him,
on
the
deck,
the
shark
lunges
again,
shifting
weight
so
that
the
boat
in
now
stern
down,
and
listing
to
the
side.
Water
from
the
sea
pours
into
the
cabin.
Another
lunge
by
the
shark.
The
huge
snout
and
jaws
slam
up
against
the
doorframe,
blocking
escape,
bloody,
gnashing.
More
seawater.
To
stay
in
the
cabin
is
to
go
down
with
the
ship.
Brody
clambers
as
far
from
the
shark
as
he
can,
against
the
forward
wall
of
the
pilothouse.
He
sees
the
window
Hooper
used
before.
It's
blocked
by
barrels
and
debris.
He
breaks
the
side
window
highest
above
the
water,
edges
out
onto
the
battered
bridge.
The
shark
rolls
around,
now
half
in
the
water.
The
ship
is
sinking,
the
sea
is
not
a
viable
alternative.
Brody
climbs
up
into
the
flying
bridge.
The
shark
is
still
lunging
and
snapping.
Brody
is
forced
to
climb
higher
and
higher
as
the
ship
slowly
sinks
beneath
him.
CLOSE
-
BRODY
He
scrambles
for
his
life
onto
the
flying
bridge,
sees
the
M-
1
stuck
there,
seizes
it.
OVER
BRODY,
LOOKING
DOWN
AT
THE
STERN
He
is
bracing
himself,
aiming
the
rifle,
taking
a
bead
on
the
steel
tanks,
silver
gleaming
in
the
bloody
shark's
mouth.
He
fires.
And
fires.
Bullets
shatter
the
shark's
teeth,
punching
holes
in
the
dripping
snout.
WIDE
ON
THE
ORCA
 
EXPLOSION
With
a
muffled
boom,
the
perfect
symmetry
of
the
shark
is
suddenly
blown
apart
in
a
geyser
of
steel
and
blood
as
Brody's
shot
hits
the
pressurized
tank.
A
30-foot
cloud
of
water,
steel,
shark
and
debris
covers
the
sky.
A
gigantic
convulsion
hurls
the
Great
White's
mangled
body
into
the
sea.
The
Orca
slowly
begins
to
turn
over
in
its
death
roll.
UNDERWATER
The
shark's
carcass
floating
down
in
a
cloud
of
blood
and
debris.
A
shadow
clouds
the
waters,
and
the
Orca's
mass
begins
to
slip
into
the
frame.
CLOSE
-
HOOPER
Emerging
from
beneath
the
surface,
he
raises
his
mask,
spits
out
his
mouthpiece
and
kicks
toward
Brody.
SURFACE
-
BRODY
AND
HOOPER
Brody
is
holding
onto
a
cushion,
barely
afloat,
relieved
the
shark
is
dead,
yet
stunned
to
see
Hooper
is
still
alive.
The
two
men
share
weak
laughter,
which
soon
trails
off.
HOOPER
Quint...?
BRODY
No...
(notices
something
O.S.)
You
think
we
can
get
back
with
those?
SURFACE
-
BRODY
AND
HOOPER
-
ANOTHER
ANGLE
They
swim
through
the
debris,
using
two
barrels
as
floats,
as
dozens
of
seagulls
feast
on
shark
remains
on
the
surface.
BRODY
What
day
is
this?
HOOPER
Wednesday...
No,
it's
Tuesday,
I
think.
BRODY
Think
the
tide's
with
us?
HOOPER
Just
keep
kicking.
BRODY
Y'know,
I
used
to
hate
the
water...
HOOPER
I
can't
imagine
why.
DISSOLVE
TO:
HIGH
SHOT
FROM
SHORE
The
two
tiny,
miserable
heroes
swim
ashore
as
the
credits
roll.
FADE
OUT:
THE
END
